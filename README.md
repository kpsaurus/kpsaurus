# Hi, I’m Krishna Prasad

I’m a full-stack developer who enjoys building clean, scalable, and well-structured web applications. I work primarily with **Django**, and **React**, and I like being involved across the stack — from backend architecture and APIs to modern frontend experiences.

I’m especially interested in writing maintainable code, designing reliable systems, and improving performance as projects grow.

|-------------------|-------|
| Backend           | Django, Django REST Framework, Wagtail, Gin |
| Frontend          | React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Ant Design |
| Data & Analytics  | Apache Airflow, dbt, Apache Spark |
| Languages         | Python, TypeScript, Go |
| Databases         | PostgreSQL, SQLite |
